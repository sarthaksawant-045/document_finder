# 🧠 Smart Document Finder  
**Offline NLP-Based Desktop Search Application**

---

## 📝 Introduction

In today’s digital world, users store thousands of documents—notes, assignments, research papers, and more. But when it's time to find something specific, they forget filenames or folder paths.

**Smart Document Finder** solves this problem using AI-powered semantic search. You can search using plain English like:

> "Give me notes on transformers from last semester."

This desktop app works **fully offline**, respects user privacy, and supports fast, contextual search over PDFs, Word, and text files.

## ⚙️ How It Works

```plaintext
1. User starts the app
2. Accepts Terms & Conditions
3. Scanner reads documents & extracts text
4. Text is chunked & converted into embeddings
5. FAISS + SQLite indexes are built
6. User enters a natural language query
7. Query is embedded & matched with stored chunks
8. Matching results are ranked and returned
